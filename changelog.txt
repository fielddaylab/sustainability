Starting this changelog 11/17/2013 so that I can keep track of what I'm working on.


11/17/13:
- Fixed table generation/update logic.
- Added building/upgrade validation upon adding upgrades.
- Fixed the "Unlock" buttons, to allow for easier testing.
- Moved all JS logic from tables.html into js/testMain.js (current working file)
- Commented a lot of code, but this is definitely an ongoing process.
